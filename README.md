# Week 5 Weekend
Create an android application which:  
1. Have a splash screen when you start the application. Splash screen should have an image like a logo displayed to 2 secs and then go to the main activity.
2. Have a pdf file viewer. You can save the pdf file in the res folder.
3. Have dialog fragment shows a picture for 3 secs.
4. Have a AlertDialog.
    - with default layout
    - with custom layout
    - with a list of options to select from (passing xml array)
5. Have a feature to send a notification using the NotificationManager and PendingIntent classes. Be creative (the user should be able to go to another activity by clicking on the notification)
6. Have a feature to send text directly from the app with inputs(Edittext) as “Text” and “Phone Number”. Use SmsManager class.
7. Have a activity with two fragments: 
    - Fragment1: two buttons (Start and Stop)
    - Fragment2: textview
    - When clicked on the Start, Fragment two should start the counter, when clicked stop the counter should be stopped. Use Timer class/TimerTask  
    
This is how the app looks like:
